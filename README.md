# A Guide For Heathy Computing

## The Problem
So far, my career has involved long amounts of time working with a computer. I've often noticed there are times during these periods that I feel uninspired, tired, slow, or weak. Not to mention how that effects life after work. This is partially due to the typical computer-based work environment we have. So what can we do since computers are currently a vital part of productive work?

## The Answer
Let's remember that a computer is only as productive as the person in front of it. The better we feel, the better our work and lives will be. The answer is to have habits and tools that make that happen consistently. Our bodies need certain things to perform and build up.

## The List
1. **PUSHUP**: Hourly, üòÖ do as many pushups as you can. Increase amounts very slowly to avoid injury. You don't need to sweat, just get your blood flowing again. You'll find this quickens your mind and makes your body feel loads better. Plus, it'll enable you to do more things in life generally!
2. **WALK**: Each mid-afternoon, ü§ô call a friend and go for a walk around the block. This will help activate that human part of your brain again and allow you to come up with creative ideas that makes sense to real people (those not in "computer mode"). Maybe you'll see something outside that will give you a new idea.
3. **FRUIT**: Each afternoon, üçè eat a green apple or other peppy fruit. Nice little pick-me-up that won't let you down.

## Other Ideas
1. **COMPUTERS**: I want to focus on human needs mostly since that is more important and gets ignored but maybe a list called "For Computers" would be good too. There are certain things we should be doing with our computers as well on a regular basis to keep them performing how we need them to so they don't slow us down. For example, recalibrating your battery might be a good annual thing to do. I just had to do it and I didn't realize this was a thing. Other ideas: disk space, archiving process, file organization, etc.
2. **HARDWARE**: I like the comparison of hardware to bodies. We need to take care of both or the progress stops.
